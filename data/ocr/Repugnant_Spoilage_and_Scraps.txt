On the Crust, mutations are more than just a side effect;
they’re a way of life! Here, bizarre transformations
spring forth from the squalid sludge, giving rise to

unusual abilities and grotesque features that can turn the
tide of any encounter. Dive into this realm of revolting
reconfigurations, where every mutation is a testament to the
power of the filth, just waiting to come to fruition! 9
BELGHGIR

MEAT: +1 FEET: +1 MUSCLES: +0 BRAINS: +0 VIBES: +3

Belchéirs are the loudmouths of the Crust, known for their booming, guttural
burps that can rally allies and shake foes to their core. With each resonant
guttural croak, Belchdirs loudly orate both inspiration and intimidation,
mastering a unique vocal range that gets stuck in your head like a tapeworm.
Armed with a bellowful belly and enchanting esophogus, these theatrical
jesters can’t help but draw a crowd.

BELCH BALLAD: 2 times per session, BELLYFUL-O-TUNES: As Belchéirs roam

FUNGHALLS

MEAT: +2 FEET: +0 MUSCLES: +0 BRAINS: +3 VIBES: +0

Funghalls, nature’s nastiest necromancers, wield spore-spewing magic through
their Spoilrot Armor—a thick, resilient suit of food mold that absorbs
attacks like that stinky sponge by the sink. Each “sporell” they wield
unleashes toxic clouds to poison, confuse, invigorate, and even reanimate,
turning the battlefield into a murky, mold-choked mess. But beware! If they’re
not mindful of their armor’s mass, they risk being overwhelmed by the very
mold they rely on. These moldy maestros show that putrid power comes with a
cost, but it’s no sweat for these sharp and studious spore masters.

SPOILED ROTTEN: Bolster and thicken STUDIOUS SPORE SAVANT: As you delve

poisoned.

(J Revitalizing Reek: Emit a rejuvenating cloud of spores that heals an

2 Points - You regain 2 Meat.

3 Points - Up to 3 enemies are confused and skip their next turn.

4 Points - Until the start of your next turn, all affected are paralyzed.

(J Black Mold: Create a nearly opaque cloud of infectious black particles
that will obfuscate and conceal anything and everyone near you. Cost: 1
Brains. Effect: You and any Close allies touching you can see perfectly
within the cloud and are unaffected. All Others become blind and sick.

[J Necrotic Nuisance: Infect a recently deceased creature with spores
invading its mind and nervous system, resurrecting it from the dead and
allowing you to puppet the creature to your wicked whim. Cost: 2 Brains.

you would take your turn, you may instead have the monster move and fight
under your command.

Starting Rubbish: Tattered terrycloth cloak, Spoiled satchel, Sporells

Now Peat has to withstand an atta

Globlin. To defend against its Snot Rocket

vattack, Peat relies on_their traffic- cone Sis

armor and rolls 3d6, resulting in a Pr

a Fluid, and a Splatter. Accepting the
2 outcomes, Peat. opts to use the Fluid
for a +1 bonus to their defense rather
than describing 4 gross embellishment
to double another die. The Splatter
allows a reroll, so Peat rerolls that
die and gets another 2. The total from
the rolls is 2 (natural) * 2 (rerolled)

+ 1 (from Fluid) = 5. With the Globlins

Threat at 4,

this Snot Rocket attack

Addressing the Gag outcome, the Collector offers up a Gag Reflex

in exchange for a +2 Bonus - “Spend a Brains unit and explain

DAMAGE RESOLUTION:

1. Determine the Threat Level: Identify the Threat level
r of the monster (€.g., 3, 7%, 16).
2. Roll the Dice: Players roll their dice and calculate
‘the total.

3. Compare Your Roll to the Threat Level:
°' If your total roll is greater than or equal to -the
Threat, you avoid all damage.

°, If your total roll is less than the Threat,
calculate the difference: NE S
