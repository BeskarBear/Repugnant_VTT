“The world was filted with garbage.

“And then it filléd with more garbage. Three to four miles daéep in’.
‘Some places... The Water got soaked in, and mixed up, aand became ~ :
a-sludge ‘that we just call planetary fluid. Now, whatever was ere pees &
here before is something we can’t remember any more. Some of us z
left, some of us stayed. People used to be a lot more alike,. but
got along far less. Now no matter if you are a massive Hoggo or.
diminutive Roacher, you’re a Dweller through.and through.

The filth doesn’t bother us, it’s what we know, how we live, and
who we are. We pick our way across The Crust and deal with our
lives the best we can. We have families, jobs, towns, villages, and
enclaves, we even have a few big cities.

Some of us have gotten a little weird. Mutations are pretty common
on The Crust. An extra eye, another mouth, the ability to control
mucus with your mind, it happens when your bodies are constantly
exposed to garbage, filth, and a low level of radiation. Most folks
who get mutations end up helping folks out, but some folks take
advantage for their own ends.

REPUGNANT?

Repugnant is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game. If you are
reading Repugnant you are probably familiar with a lot of
the basic ideas, terms, and concepts of many roleplaying
games. If you aren’t I am not quite sure how you: got
here... but welcome! In Repugnant most players take on
the-mole efefeeuaracter calted-a Dwellers -tkbey- use that
character’s background, Skuz, and abikities to take actions
and make choices. Sometimes those abilities will be risky
or have a chance of turning out lots of

different ways and the player will need

to make} a Throw by tosstng

a hand#tudof.Chits -om=to a sheet
called “The Heap” to see what the
outcome is. They do this when the
Collector, a player with a different
role, tells them to. The
Collector is the 1 player who
tells the others what the SS
world around them is like,
controls ‘the other characters
in the story, and decides when
someone needs to Throw for an action.
They narrate what happens from the
outcome. They are NOT the boss of the
game. They typically are someone who
put a little extra time into-learning
the rules and coming up with an outline
for a story or adventure. Roleplaying
games are collaborations around the table
between ALL players no matter what their
role. The type of adventures you go on
and stories you tell depend on you, but
Repugnant is great if you want to do

the following:

: a

Every Dweller has access to gross abltities- faa baene=2o0sely
defined so that you can find out what they do in play. They
gain more powers as they advance-and gain mastery over them.

FIGHT FETID FIENDS

The Crust is a dangerous place, and you will regularly find
yourself in dangér:-and at risk from creatures. Most of these
are not Dwellers, a few are. There are monsters, critters,
primordial forces, and new emerging threats for you to deal
with.

The Crust is pock marked with homesteads, villages, cities,
and hidden away communities. Each of them have their own
needs and are looking for locals or travelers to help them.
You can dive deep into one community, or move around helping
lots of them.

PLAY WITH PUTRID PALS

The most important. part -of Repugnant is therabitity to
hang out.with a few friends, either new or old, to have
adventures and a good time! Having a gross good time
with “your. other players: isthe -#1:2focus- of A Ysession of
Repugnant.

TES

5

Sitting down in advance and taking time to discuss
limits are important. We recommend using a Red, Yellow,
Green, System.

Red means something is off limits. It could be something that
makes ,you gag, or it could be a theme you are unwilling to
explore as part of play. The Collector and other players
know to avoid these topics narratively. You are not reguired
to explain why you don’t like them.

Yellow means handle with care or go slow. When dealing
with items you identify as yellow it means you check. in}
with folks at the table when they come‘up. You might !need
to skip’ explicit descriptiens,.or handle these. themes in
particular ways.

Green means you are excited by or ready to, engage in these
things . This could be themes you love, ideas\ you, want to
explore, moments of interaction that are impdrtant. Types
of gross you love, or an ongoing joke you want to.see
happen. It’s good to define these in shales \ URE also ‘to
come Jback to them from session to session.\ THis is a living
document and should be updated by everyone when it makes
sense to ido so. 5

Muscles measures your physical abilities. Acts of strength,

Skuz Magnitude & Skuz Units:-Lets Get Skuzzed

Magnitude’ is your total power for each Skuz. It’s a combination of
your Dweller’s.Kin and Mutation aspects and represents your current
maximum Skuz potential. This is the big number that tells you how
many chits or dice you roll when tackling tasks or challenges. So,
the higher your Magnitude, the more you toss.

Chit Tosses are ldockéd to that Magnitude number. So if your
Magnitude is 4,.you toss 4 chits. That’s fixed for the task at hand,
no matter what.

Skuz Units are separate—these are limttead resources that power up.
your Kin and Mutation abilities, typically adding’ extra Gh tsganor

Players may choosé to spend multiple Skuz units at once to

challenging tasks with extra chits. But-be careful—Skuz units: are a
limited resource, and once spent, they don’t come back until you’ve
rested. ;

that damage.

Much like Skuz, Carcass comes from your Kin and.Mutation aspects,
but instead of a resource you can spend, it’s more like your
physical condition—it’s’a fixed value that represents how much
damage, your body can take.

you might’ even become injured, leaving you vulnerable:

Dwellers come in avast range of shapes, sizes, colors,

and smells, but since most of them split off of a common
ancestral Kinfolk a long time ago everyone tends to get
along. Any small to medium sized town will have a mix of
Hoggos, Vermals, Roachers, and Meatsacks. Even the recent

It's rare to see a solitary Roacher. They are anong the most socially

around them. They take up less space than most other Kinfolks and
often find small spots near lots of Dwellers to make small simple

Repugnant is played like most RPG

Collector, describing what is hap
and then asking the other players to describe what their
characters are doing. Lots of the time, this just happens
because it makes sense. Sometimes The Collector Wald 1 tasie

the other players what is happening of how something works.

Still other times you need to use a tool to help figure out

if something happens one way OF another. In Repugnent we.use

a tool called The Heap to help decide if cervaan
things happen of don’t.

27

the Heap is .simply-a piece of paper. There are hundreds, of heaps
across the Crust, "but all have the following elements at minimum, a
person in the middle, the 4 essences (vomit, phlegm, biGod, “gas),;
along with a Yes/No indicator. Feel free to make your own, or use
the one provided.
To use The Heap you take a handful of Chits and make a Throw. the
number of Chits you throw and the way you throw them depends .on the
type of action you are taking but they are typicaily determined by
the type of Skuz that is appropriate for .that -action: Muscles for
physical or direct action. Brains for mental or cunning actions.
Vibes for™social or Savvy actions... You can iso Geeoan extra chit
if you describe your action in a gross way. If you Gross out The
Collector with a description they should give you even more chits.

Once y&u have your Chits in hand there are 3 main types of Throws:
Take the Chits and drop them all at once
on the heap from-about 18 inches above.
Pha Sass typically used for overt, direct,

Physical actions and will often correspond
to Muscles.

Take the Chits and toss them on to the heap
from about 18 inches away« This is typically
used tor clever, SUiimienCe aor ranged ‘dctions
and will often correspond to Brains.

and flick it onto the heap from at least a

There are a few key terms and descriptions that might be helpful to
know while using abilities in Repugnant.

Range
There are 4 abstract Ranges in Repugnant:

NEAR, CLOSE, EAR, VERY FAR

* Near is anything that you can touch or get to in_a-step or two.

Close is anything you can get to after moving a short distance.
Far is anything that would take a few rounds to get close to.

Very Far anything that is out of range or beyond your capability to
reach.

Generally speaking characters Can move 1 anges each round. of
combat. If speed matters you can make a Feet throw to see if you
can move-more quickly or to navigate obstacles.

V a
Tags <a :
= pinererare a Llarge=number of “Tags” that you may s¢ee accompanying
abilities, monsters, items or that the Collector may. attach to you
or an.item. Most of these are directly descriptive. Here are a
few examples: =
Sleep: Indicates the ability, creature, or item, has the capacity
to make the target fall asleep. Be
Area: Means that the move affects an area (anythimg in a Near range
typically).
Mind Control: Allows’ you to take control of a creature or
character. Talk=€6"- yous piayeee about what boundaries are

There is also a tag that says Negotiated on many high level
abilities for Dwellers. The Negotiated tag means. that players and
The. Collector work together to figqurc{out what bonuses of Fags get
created based on the narrative and the intent. These should always.

Represented in many ways on different Heaps, but commonly an X and
! to signify caution and excitement in turn.-These are*“the daily
experiences of any and every Dweller. When choosing to move ahead
or not, or discerning between binary options, let the impulses
guide you. -

Ee THE SPHERES

The Spheres represent the 3 dimensions of a Dweller. A) Vibes on
the surface. B) Muscles in the body C) Brains in the mind. When,
your throw on the heap matches the skuz you are using, expect
increased output!

THE PRIMORDIALS

Every Dweller also carries within them the 4 Primérdials. A) Vomit
B) Phlegm C) Blood D) Gas when accessing a Primordial. ss

As the day and night on the Crust are split into 7 segments or
divisions; so is The Heap. Hitting the right moment .or a chance
encounter depends on the divisions.

THE GHITS

Every Chit has two elements: Points (which
are both literal points of a triangle ‘and

a “point” of value counting towards, meeting
or exceeding the challenge of a task or
encounter) and Fluid. Chits can be made out
of anything as ‘long as i tside-has a 41 biack
point and a visible fluid drop, and the other
. Side has two black points.

When throwing chits count the number of
Blacked in Points showing to determine the
total number™your Throw scores = Ex: if you
throw 3 =chits—the highest amount of points
you might get would be 6 (with no Fluid)
and the Lowest amount would be 3 (with all
showing Fluid)

diegetically (Outside the story’s world, not perceived by the
characters, but intended for the audience.).-That’s a fancy way of

saying you. can have the Dwellers consult The Heap (Digetic) or the
Players make a resolution Throw (nondiegetic). P

When the Dwellers in world use it in the narrative; ask them who is
checking The Heap, what their chits look like, where they got their
Heap, andvJwhy they trust it before they make a throw.

When the Dwellers use The Heap make sure *they-know they can ask to
-Hit The Mark. :

-Understand the Impulses.

=Track the Divisiens.

These are things most Dwellers would know how to do.
When the Players use it to mechanically .resolve choices, ask them

what they-are trying to’ do, what. Skuz they .are using, and what type
of Throw (Flop, -Fling, ‘Flick) makes the most sense.

When the Players use The Heap onboard them slowly.
"-Teach, them the types of Throws and their intent

F -Tell them how to count the points to beat a Threat number.
-After they understand the basics add in The Dimensions &

Encourage your players to make their own chits or even experiment
with alternative Heaps inspired by your play. :

Collectors should read The Heap like an oracle. Explain what

you think the heap -is saying -to your players, jet plavyers-ask
questions, but above-all try to be sconsus tent tromemoment.. Co-monment

Across The Crust there are a number of fetid fiends and mucky
monstrosities you might encounter. Each of them are boiled down to
2 simple stats, Threat and Hits.

Threat is the target number you need to throw at or over when
attempting to attack, threaten, or influence these creatures
sucgcesstully. Lf your Poeints mateh, this nmutiber you .de L “hit; x= you
double that number you hit twice, if you triple that number you hit
ECHELGS, and .sO on. This is also-the number you must throw at or
above when defending yourself from these creatures.

HITS

= Hits represents the general health and fortitude of the creature.
Once you have eliminated all a creature’s hits, they will no longer
fight you. This could be because of death, scaring them off, or

THER befriending them depending on your approach.
=
= In addition to Threat and Hits each entry comes with a description
along with Features & Tactics that a particular fiend might use.
Features are mostly narrative and can be used freely by the fiends.
JS / Tactics are special abilities the Collector can trigger in combat
357 or other appropriate situations. Each creature can trigger as many
vj = tactics as they have Threat per combat. These reduce the number of
TT (fe Chits thrown by players when defending by 1 per defending player or

can add shits to the monsters toss, or add special effects.

DEFENCE AND DAMAGE

he bs When being attacked by a monster, dodging a trap, or otherwise
» +E = trying to avoid getting hurt, you make a Meat or Feet throw to
“hy either endure (meat) or dodge (feet). Just like with
RSS other Throws you throw as many chits as you have Magnitude boosted
by abilities, items, and of course your disgusting description. The

Eyeballers rely totally on Sight and are near
hairless, the Digithingi is blind, covered in

. coarse hair, and navigates the crust by feel.
Using its powerful arms and jaws Digithingis
will loosen then shovel the loam into their
mouths, tunneling at a high speed. The barely
chewed bite of terra firma is digested in an
instant and transformed into a horrendous gas.
This gas then released, propelling the
Digithingi like a cannonball. Roachers and
Vermals are known to sometimes wrangle and
ride a Digithingi, &rasping into its odorous
tress of hair as it butt blasts through
underground tunnels and sewer pipes.

Pure water is a scarce substance on The Crust.
One creature evolved to meet.that scarcity, the
Urinators. With massive porebladders covering

liquid it comes into contact with. They are able
to quickly filter that water, and what gets
filtered out waits in one of the many porebladers
on the Urinators head, arms, and legs. Each

Nothing on the Crust is more infamous or singularly feared than
the Yechey. Every extreme of filthiness is personified by this being
of pure unyielding nastiness. Using its palatable stench, excellent
hearing and keen sense of smell the ever sniffling Yechey tracks
its prey endlessly. It's stench is otherworldly, and causes vision to
blur and a loss of your sense of smell. It's snot rockets can knock
out @ Meatsack and its gnarled nails render flesh with ease. The
Crust is governed by the balance of the 4 humors, vomit, phlegm,
blood, gas. Blood is the one that the Yechey requires and little has

ever stopped it from getting what it wants.

For every towering spire of trash littered about

The Phelmite stone is a decroded schnose shaped, booger grown
large over many centuries and many layers of snot hardening
into a dense stone like substance. It is fabled to be the very
essence of all Phlegm on the crust, perhaps the universe and is
almost certainly the patron of all Slimoores. A shard of the
Phiegmite stone is said to carry mucus magic that can fetch a
high price and grants its owner powers untold. If undisturbed,
the Phlegmite Stone will lie dormant but if awoken will conjure
a frightening forn, spewing mucus from its enlarged nostrils,
until it congeals into a towering mass of sticky, slippery,
pointy and snotty slime. If that wasn't seary enough, once the
Phlegmite Stone has taken the Form of the Booger Boss it can
flick hunks of itself at attackers known as Phlegmings.
Phlegmings are basically creatures in their own right, able to
fight and defend the Phiegmite stone until they're reabsorbed.

CR ENTRAL

Need to quickly Cavort around The
Crust? The easiest way to find a
ride wherever you need to go is
to visit Grand Sewer Station. The
station is the hydraulic heart of
travel across the region. Faster
. than a garbage barge, and less
deadly than training an GiAnt,
the sewage soaked hydraulic
lines of the Grand%Central
always run on timeish. The 3:10
to Yuka,, Soilent Express, and
“Flying Scatman are the pride of
the, haughty family that run the
f station, The Hamtrack clan. As
the only means of high speed
transCrust travel, the Hamtracks
keep prices high and deal harshly
with rail hopper stowaways.

The only train on the line that
isn’t under the dominion .of, the
Hamtracks. The Snot Rocket is a
train caty run by the Nuggets, a
group:.of Silimores ,that believe
in tree. travel for al lyaas sheng

as they can hetp keep the train
running. Slimores aré always
accepted since they can help
pump the hydraulics, but_oether
Dwellers have to prove their 3

value to get a ride.

SCRABBY BEACH

Ah, who doesn’t like,a relaxing
day at the beach? Viscous spittle
sprayang-from: the Sprct=Up Pat,
warm fart clouds wafting through
the breeze, the slick plastine
pellets of plastand between your
toes, the unmistakable crunch of
delicious Scab Crab egg platelets
under your feet; hey don” t eat at
all! Just another perfect day at
Scrabby Beach. Speaking of these
erunchy, salty, scabby delights;
don’t snack on them at daybreak

‘when the Scab Crabs come out to

peel their progény from the shore
or a sweaty slash of their claws
might wash up on your face.

Some sections of the Crust have
been dug out low enough that

“ruins from the ancient world are

unearthed. Most common among them
are what historians refer to as
Sewers. These well constructed
tunnels and processing facilities
seem to have been used for
transporting all kinds of things
im the=Gildewo wid aa quads,

waste, giant combat reptiles and
of course subterranean travel.
Sewer Ruins on the Crust are
numerous and perilous, often
holding treasure and mysteries
unknown, shortcuts, secret paths

along with lots of unseen or

rare monsters that dwelid in the
dank darkness.

Welcome to Stinkpunch Ridge, a small dusty town With an excess of
old tires, dog droppings,. and problems. Situated-on the edge of The
Crust- with a main-street that teads to a disgusting dive bar called
the 3Barrel. The town is bagked by a giant tire. ridge. that—tooks. -
like they could tumble at amy moment. The population is mostly ¢
hoggos and vermals with a small clutch of roachers & a few meatsack
families. Severdi ‘folks have gone missing over the last month
causing the town to send out a request for help on the Garbage
Barge. ; :

You have beén hired to help find out what is causing folks to go.
~missing and, if possible, puta stop te it:

However, upon arriving the party will learn from anyone they talk
to that in addition to the growing list of missing townsfolk a
group of young people “were brutally attacked out near the Tiredge
a few nights back. Two went missing and the 4 that returned are
brutally injured.

THE SIGHTS OF! STINKPUNCH RIDGE

The 3Barrel dominates the end of main street.
This dive bar has 3 flavors to drink: Green,
Brown, & Black. The gentle hoggo constable
Strex is typically found here chatting with
Harold-the reacher bertbenders. TEs wacked. at
night and has a table or two of locals at any time ot day. Strexias
your point of contact as they and Harold lead StinkPunch. 24
Special: Ask the players to describe the flavor of the drinks if
they try them. Award the best description an extra point in Skuz-
for the next day - Green +Shame, Brown +Revulsion, Black +Disgust.
Secret: The bathroom to the dive bar is a simple trough & 2 stall
a@ieir, but Lt anyone makes their way under the toilets they will
discover the simple sewer running under the main street with a
trail of réddish wile coming in from a smatl hole. ~~
